This is important!

Some of the files in this project are NOT FREE.  When I was writing the site, I didn't want to get bogged down in tweaking CSS, so I bought a licensed design template via themeforest.net.

I'm okay putting this stuff up on a public Git repository because, hey, it's the web.  You can swipe these assets for yourself any time you want.  I just want to remind you not to be a jerk about it.  :)

Here's the list of stuff that came with the original template (note that some of these assets, notably the JavaScript, are themselves freely available):

./content/assets/css/style.css
./content/assets/fonts/*
./content/assets/images/*
./content/assets/js/jquery*.js
./content/assets/js/superfish.js
