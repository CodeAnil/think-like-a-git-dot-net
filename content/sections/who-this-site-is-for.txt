"Advanced beginners" with Git.  You should know how to create a repository, add and commit files to it, and you should probably have some idea of why you might want to use a branch.

If you're still struggling with what version control software is for, this site may not be that useful to you.  **I encourage you to poke around,** but if you're not getting much out of it, check out my <%= page_link 'reading-list' %> for some pointers, and consider coming back to this site later.

I'm not going to teach you the basics of adding and committing files.  I'm not going to tell you (well, not explicitly) how Git is different from Subversion.
