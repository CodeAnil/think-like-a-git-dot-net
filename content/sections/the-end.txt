<blockquote style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.2em;">Where do we go from here?<br />
Where do we go from here?<br />
The battle's done, and we kind of won<br />
So we sound our victory cheer<br />
Where do we go from here?<br /><br />

Technically, this isn't the end&mdash;this is just all I've written so far.  I hope you've enjoyed reading this, and I really hope I've been able to help you learn something.

**I welcome your feedback!**  Feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:geeksam@gmail.com">email</a> or a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/geeksam">tweet</a> and let me know what you think.

If there are areas of Git that you'd like to understand better, speak up!  I've been motivated to write this much because I gave one presentation three times, and kept hearing from people that it really helped them.  I'm happy to add more to this site as I have time, but that's much more likely if you let me know that you're paying attention, and tell me what you want to see.

Happy hacking!<br />
