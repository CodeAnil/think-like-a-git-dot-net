In the previous page, I said graph theory boils down to places to go, and ways to get there.  Let's have another look at the definition I used earlier.

> A graph refers to a collection of **nodes** and a collection of **edges** that connect pairs of nodes.

**Nodes:**  Places to be <br />
**Edges:**  Ways to get there

In the KÃ¶nigsberg example, the land masses and islands are nodes, and the bridges are edges.
