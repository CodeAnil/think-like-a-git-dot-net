About half of my interactions with Git take place on the command line.  But **when I want to understand what's going on, I use a visual Git tool.**  On the Mac, the best thing I've found is **<a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">GitX</a>**.  On other systems, **gitk** should be available; you can search the web to find something that works for you.

The main point of using a visualizer is to **help you make sense of your branch history.**  For example, to list all commits in your repository at the command line, you could do <code class="inline">git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --branches=*</code>&mdash;which will get you this:

<div class="wp-caption">
  <img src="/assets/images2/textual-git-log.png" class="no-shadow" />
  <br /><strong>Clear as mud, right?</strong>
</div>
<%= clearer %>

Or, you can use GitX, which will show you this *slightly more useful* view:

<div class="wp-caption">
  <img src="/assets/images2/gitx-visualization.png" class="no-shadow" />
  <br /><strong>Could you tell there were branches from the terminal output?  Me either.</strong>
</div>
