I use GitX in almost every coding session.  GitX behaves like a web browser in one very important way:  **it won't immediately reflect changes to your repository**&mdash;you have to hit **Cmd+R** to tell it to **(R)**efresh its view.

<div class="fr wp-caption pad-left">
  <a href="http://store.xkcd.com/xkcd/#StandBackScience"><img src="/assets/images2/xkcd-try-science.png" class="no-shadow" /></a>
  <br /><strong>It's a great shirt. You know you want one.</strong>
</div>

You can use this to your advantage.  Here's how:  **when you've done something on the command line,** switch back to your visualizer, but **don't refresh right away.**  Instead, try to predict how what you did will change its view.  *(You can even try drawing out the graph on an index card.)*  Then, refresh the visualizer and ask yourself:  **did it change in the way you expected?**

**If the answer is YES:**  Congratulations!  You just learned something!

**If the answer is NO:**  Congratulations!  You're about to learn something!

Repeat this process several thousand times, and eventually you won't need to refer to the visualizer as often.  *(For those of you who like bad sci-fi movies, think of it as less "Use the force, Luke" and more **"Usul no longer needs the weirding module."**)*
