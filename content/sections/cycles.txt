**You're almost there!**  There's just one more thing you need to know about graphs that will help you understand Git -- the concept of **reachability**.  If you're eager to jump ahead, <%= page_link('reachability', 'feel free') %>.

  <br /><strong>Directed Acyclic Graph</strong>
</div>

If you're still here, let's talk about cycles.  For purposes of working with Git, you can think of a cycle as **a route through a graph that lets you get back to where you started.**

There's an example over to the right.  Trace it out&mdash;no matter where you start, you shouldn't be able to get to the same node twice.

<%= clearer %>

I mention this mostly because, when people talk about Git, they may say something like **"a Git repository is a directed acyclic graph,"** and I want you to know what that means.  **"Graph"** is obvious&mdash;I've been going on about graphs for pages and pages now.  **"Directed"** just means that an edge from A to B isn't the same as an edge from B to A.  And **"acyclic"** means "doesn't have cycles."

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed acyclic graphs</a> are so interesting to computer scientists that they're often referred to as DAGs.  But if you're reading this page, I'm guessing you don't already have a background in computer science, so I'll shut up now and tell you the last thing you need to know.
