Git's <code class="inline">rebase</code> command was one of those things that it took me forever to figure out.  This was partly because I just had a lot to learn about managing branches in general, but it was also partly because it seemed like the only time people bothered to write about rebase was to say <%= section_link('example-4-lsd-and-chainsaws', 'how incredibly weird and dangerous it was') %>.

This is a damn shame, because **rebase is the single most useful command I use in Git**.  More importantly, **it's actually pretty easy to understand once you get the hang of it.**

If you'll bear with me, I think it's much easier to explain rebase in the context of another Git command:  <code class="inline">git cherry-pick</code>.
