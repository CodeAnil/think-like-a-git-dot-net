This site was created by Sam Livingston-Gray.  You can find out more about me at my <a href="http://resume.livingston-gray.com">resume website</a>.

This began life as a "Lunch and Learn" presentation to my coworkers.  Based on the positive feedback I got from that, I then gave the talk again at Portland BarCamp 2011, and again later at Cascadia RubyConf 2011.

(There's video of that talk <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/612-cascadiaruby2011-think-like-a-git">here</a>, but keep in mind that I actually had zero warning that I was going to talk that day -- the keynote speaker ran short, and the conference organizers asked if anybody there had had a talk proposal rejected, but had their slides ready to go.  I raised my hand, and three minutes later I was up on stage.)

Based on encouraging feedback from both of those talks, I wanted to turn the talk into a series of screencasts... but I thought writing it out would actually be a bit easier, and might be more accessible.  (I like screencasts for some things, but I also find it hard to set time aside to watch them.)  If you'd like to see screencasts based on this material, let me know.
