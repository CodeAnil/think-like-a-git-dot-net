Because a Git branch is just a 40-byte file on disk, **it takes orders of magnitude more time for you to tell the computer to create a branch** (by typing <code class="inline">git branch foo</code>) **than for your computer to actually do it.**

And because branches are references, and *(say it with me now)* <%= section_link('references make commits reachable') %>, **creating a branch is a way to "nail down" part of the graph** that you might want to come back to later.

And because neither <code class="inline">git merge</code> nor <code class="inline">git rebase</code> will change your existing commits (<%= section_link('garbage-collection', 'remember') %>, a commit's ID is a hash of its contents ***and its history***), you can create a temporary branch any time you want to try something you're even just a little bit unsure about.

In other words, creating a branch is like saving your game before you battle the boss.
