Here are two versions of the KÃ¶nigsberg map.  On the left is a smaller version of the map you've already seen, and on the right is the version Euler used in his 1735 proof.

<%= render :partial => 'sections/konigsberg-map-and-graph' %>

Here's what I think is so mind-bendingly cool about this:  **Euler threw away all the information that didn't matter to the problem.**  

If all you're concerned with is which bridges you cross, then for all intents and purposes, **the entire city can be boiled down to four abstract points in space**, and the **bridges are just lines that connect those points**.

Which is why I say you can boil graph theory down to the study of **places to go, and ways to get there.**
