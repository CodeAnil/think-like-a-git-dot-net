<h1><abbr title="Too Long; Didn't Read">TL;DR</abbr></h1>

<ul class="full-size">
  <li>Git is an incredibly powerful tool, but it can be hard to learn.</li>
  <li>It helps to know something about <%= section_link('graph theory') %>, especially with regard to <%= section_link('reachability') %>.</li>
  <li>And to know what Git's <%= section_link('references') %> are.</li>
  <li>Because <strong><%= section_link('references make commits reachable') %>.</strong> <br /><em>(Only got time to read one more page?  Make it that one.)</em></li>
  <li>Once you understand that, you won't waste so much time backing up your entire repository, <%= section_link('my-humble-beginnings', 'like I did') %>.</li>
  <li><%= section_link('use-your-targeting-computer-luke', 'I like GitX') %>, and you can use it (or another visualizer) to bootstrap your knowledge of Git.</li>
  <li>I've got a few recipes for <%= section_link('testing out merges') %> that give you an "undo" option.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Alternate Media</h1>

If lots of text isn't your thing, you can check out the material I based this site on:

<ul class="full-size">
  <li><a href="http://think-like-a-git.heroku.com/">HTML slideshow</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/612-cascadiaruby2011-think-like-a-git">Confreaks video</a> from Cascadia RubyConf, July 2011 (note that I gave the talk with zero preparation, so it's a bit unpolished)</li>
</ul>
