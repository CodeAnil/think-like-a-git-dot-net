Git has a famously steep learning curve.

Once people achieve some level of Git enlightenment, they tend to make statements of the form 'Git gets a lot easier once you realize X' -- but that doesn't do much to help people staring up that steep slope.

When you're just getting started, something as straightforward as a merge can be terrifying. It can take a long time to really become comfortable using some of Git's more advanced features.

This website aims to provide two things:

 - a very gentle introduction to graph theory, and
 - a simple strategy for safely experimenting with Git operations,

so that you can build comfort and confidence with this incredibly useful tool.
