## Introduction

Git is [in]famously hard to learn.

When you're just getting started, something as straightforward as a merge can be terrifying. It can take a long time to really become comfortable using some of Git's more advanced features.  *(It took me a year or two.)*

Once people achieve some level of **Git enlightenment,** they tend to make statements of the form 'Git gets a lot easier once you realize X' -- but that doesn't do much for people staring up Git's steep learning curve.

My goal with this site is to help you, Dear Reader, understand what those smug bastards are talking about.
