<h1>TODO</h1>

* Skim, possibly link up YouTube video of YUI Theater talk on Git (via <%= twitter_user('codertales') %>): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB6r9Y7mqyU&feature=youtube_gdata_player
* Continue section on rebase, adding a simple recipe, explaining --abort, and talking about interactive rebasing
  * also explaining why one would want to use it (hat tip to Cameron Thomas on the pdxruby list for this)
* Cover push and pull
* Talk a bit about git reset, probably linking to http://progit.org/2011/07/11/reset.html
* Find and attribute sources for all images
* per @jseifer, consider explaining the stash *(jason says in reachability/savepoint section, but it probably deserves its own page)*
* maybe add per-page comments, *maybe* (not sure how this would work in epic mode)
