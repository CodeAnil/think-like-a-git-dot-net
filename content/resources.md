    <a href="http://progit.org/">Pro Git</a>, occasional blog and 2009 book by Scott&nbsp;Chacon
    <div class="reading-note">
      I have to admit that I haven't actually read this one&mdash;it was suggested by <a href="http://jasonseifer.com/">Jason Seifer</a>.  Looks like an interesting blog, and as I've said elsewhere on the site, Scott Chacon's knowledge of Git is... impressive.  <strong>(Note:  free blog promoting for-pay book, so I'm listing it in the free section.)</strong>

    <a href="http://hginit.com/00.html">Subversion Re-Education</a> page on a Mercurial tutorial site by Joel&nbsp;Spolsky
    <div class="reading-note">
      Mercurial is a different distributed version control system, but this one page is incredibly useful if you're coming to Git from Subversion or another centralized system.
