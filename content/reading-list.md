    <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">The Git Parable</a>, blog post by Tom Preston-Werner (May 2009).
    <div class="reading-note">
      Explains why you might want to use Git, and why it has some of the features it has.  At end, provides links to a few other resources that may be useful.

    <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git">The Thing About Git</a> by Ryan Tomayko (April 2008).
    <div class="reading-note">
      One of the best single blog posts I've ever read about Git.  Explains a lot, especially what the index is.

    <a href="http://progit.org/">Pro Git</a>, blog and book by Scott Chacon
    <div class="reading-note">
      I have to admit that I haven't actually read this one&mdash;it was suggested by <a href="http://jasonseifer.com/">Jason Seifer</a>.  Looks like an interesting blog, and as I've said elsewhere on the site, Scott Chacon's knowledge of Git is... impressive.

  <li>
    <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/git">Peepcode screencast on Git</a> ($12)
    <div class="reading-note">
      I found this helpful when I was completely new to Git.  Haven't revisited it in a few years.

  <li>
    <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/git-internals-pdf">Git Internals PDF</a> by Scott Chacon (also $12 via Peepcode)
    <div class="reading-note">
      More detail than you could ever possibly want on how Git works.  I've read maybe half of it.  It's incredible.
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://hginit.com/00.html">Subversion Re-Education</a> on the HgInit site
    <div class="reading-note">
      It's a site about Mercurial (another distributed version control system), but this one page is incredibly useful if you're coming to Git from Subversion or another centralized system.
    </div>

    <a href="http://blip.tv/open-source-developers-conference/git-for-ages-4-and-up-4460524">Git for Ages 4 and Up</a> by Michael Schwern (Flash video, 2010)
    <div class="reading-note">
      If you've got 45 minutes to spare, this is a great talk.  Schwern engages your kinesthetic and spatial reasoning faculties to help you understand what Git is doing.

    <div class="reading-note">
      Chatty blog post with lots of entertaining pictures.  You'll hardly notice you're learning stuff.
