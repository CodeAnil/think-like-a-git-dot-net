This is the source I use to generate [think-like-a-git.net](http://think-like-a-git.net/).

Once I wrote and launched the site, I've been extremely lax about coming back and writing any sort of updates.  So I thought that maybe, if I put it up on GitHub, people might want to send me pull requests, and that would prompt me to pay a little more attention to the site.

We'll see...
